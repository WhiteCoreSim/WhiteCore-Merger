These textures have been collected from various sources:

1. Blender Texture Disk

Notice of rights

This is the collection of textures and materials of the "Blender Texture Disk", a product created by the company "NaN Technologies" in 2001, and later sold in the blender.org e-shop to support Open Source Blender development.

The Blender Foundation has now decided to open up this content entirely as public domain. We wish you a lot of fun with the collection!

2. Hawaiian Plant Textures

I am placing these texture maps into the public domain; if you want higher resolutions or have any other questions or feedback, please contact me: info@vterrain.org

3. Golgotha Textures

Golgotha was a game under development by Crack Dot Com. When game development was abandoned, the authors generously donated their work to the public domain.


4. Some made by me, Babblefrog

A few of the wood textures were created by me using Wood Workshop. These I donate to the public domain.
